# astromap

geocoded location, altitude, IAU code, principal instruments, 
organization, targets/science, and photo of selected 
astronomical observatories. 

 *  astromap is not a map. it's a description of places in KML
    which can be loaded into many mapping applications, e.g.
    Google Maps or Bing Maps.
 *  it does not contain all known telescopes, nor even all 
    known observatories. it's a selection of major observatories
    often hosting many telescopes.
 *  it is intended to complement [more complete][1] observatory 
    maps and lists with more or less information in a short 
    summary and a photo.
 *  it is a subset of:
    *  List of Observatories, Wikipedia
    *  List of largest optical reflecting telescopes, Wikipedia
    *  List of largest optical refracting telescopes, Wikipedia
    *  List of Radio Telescopes, Wikipedia (TBD)
    *  Large Telescopes, Nine Planets
    *  Historic Astronomical Sites, NOAO

    <https://raw.github.com/siznax/astromap/master/astromap.kml>

 *  **how can i view the map in Google Maps?**
    1. Specify the KML file as a query parameter.
       eg. <http://maps.google.com/maps?q=https://raw.github.com/siznax/astromap/master/astromap.kml>
    2. Create a map in "My Places" and import the _astromap_ KML file.
    3. Create an HTML page with <code>google.maps.KmlLayer(kml)</code>
       see eg/layer-google.html

 *  **how can i view the map in Bing Maps?**
    1. Specify the KML file as a query parameter.
       eg. <http://www.bing.com/maps/?mapurl=https://raw.github.com/siznax/astromap/master/astromap.kml>
    2. Specify a Google map URL as a query parameter.
       <code>http://www.bing.com/maps/?mapurl={gmap_url}</code>
    3. Create an HTML page with <code>VEShapeSourceSpecification</code>
       see eg/layer-bing.html

 *  **where is the KMZ file?**
    1. You can create one on GPS Visualizer.
