# Astromap

Geocoded location, altitude, [IAU
code](http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/ObsCodesF.html),
principal instruments, organization, targets/science, website, and
photo of selected astronomical observatories. "optical.kml" and
"radio.kml" are merged into "astromap.kml".

Astromap is not a map.

 *  It's a description of places in KML which can be loaded into many
    mapping applications (see _Map Visualizers_ below)
 *  It does not contain all known telescopes, nor even all known
    observatories. it's a selection of major observatories often
    hosting many telescopes.
 *  It is intended to complement [more
    complete](http://www.eso.org/~ndelmott/obs_sites.html) observatory
    maps and lists with more or less information in a short summary
    and a photo.
 *  It is a subset (but hopefully representative) of:
    *  List of Observatories, Wikipedia
    *  List of largest optical reflecting telescopes, Wikipedia
    *  List of largest optical refracting telescopes, Wikipedia
    *  List of Radio Telescopes, Wikipedia
    *  Large Telescopes, Nine Planets
    *  Historic Astronomical Sites, NOAO

### Format

Observatory names have the form:

    name (elevation) IAU code

Observatory descriptions have the form:

    location | instruments | organizations | science | URL
